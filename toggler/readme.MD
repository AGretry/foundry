### Description
This module currently adds or removes 60 ft of dim vision on the scenes currently active tokens if the item `Goggles of Night` is found on a character when the character sheet is opened (rendered) and the goggles are equipped. Unequipping removes 60 ft of dim vision. I plan to include additional toggles as I think of them.
