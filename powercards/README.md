This is abso-bally-lutely a super, duper basic alpha version that has no frilly features other than making a pretty card in chat. 
```yaml
Do NOT ask me for help making powercards. Figure it out on your own for now.

## Sample Powercard
Spelling and capitalization matters when using an attribute call such as @{Mouse|dex}.
```yaml
!power {{
--emote|Mouse stabs viciously at her foe with a jagged shortsword.
--title|Shortsword
--title_txcolor|#FFFFFF
--title_bgcolor|#004400
--subtitle|« Melee Weapon Attack • Reach (5 ft) »
--Attack:|[[1d20 + @{Mouse|pb} + @{Mouse|dex} ]] | [[1d20 + @{Mouse|pb} + @{Mouse|dex} ]] vs @{Goblin|ac} AC
--Damage:|[[1d6 + @{Mouse|dex} ]] piercing
--Critical Hit:|[[1d6]] additional damage
}}
```
