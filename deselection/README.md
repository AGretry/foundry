## Foundry 0.4.0 Update
As of November 16th, 2019, the module.json includes a minimumCoreVersion 0.4.0 and will cease to work for earlier installs. If you update the module accidentally, just open module.json and change the minimumCoreVersion to 0.3.9 or delete that line. Either will work to restore usage of the Deselection module.
