### Description
The Points of Interest Actor Sheet adds a new Actor Sheet for the D&D 5e System that allows you to create points of interest on a world map using an actor sheet and token instead of using a Journal and making a map note. There are several benefits to making points of interest this way, but it has the potential to add "bloat" to your Actor directory in the sidebar.

1. You are not limited to a specific set of icons for map notes. You can use any image for your point of interest on the map, the same way you would change an actor's token.
2. You can right click and hide or reveal a point of interest token on the map.
3. The selection border matches the grid shape (square or hex). Yay for OCD.
4. The sheet could potentially be expanded to include stats for points of interest for strategic gameplay like Pathfinder Kingmaker.
